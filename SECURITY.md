- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 2. What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies by severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 30 days
  - Medium: 90 days
  - Low: Next release cycle

### 3. Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue
- Don't publicly disclose until we've released a fix
- Don't exploit the vulnerability
- Act in good faith

### 4. Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Acknowledged in our SECURITY.md (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Listed in release notes for the fix
- Eligible for our bug bounty program (details below)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users/Operators

#### Production Deployment

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Use HTTPS/TLS** - Always encrypt traffic
3. **Secure Bitcoin RPC** - Use strong passwords, firewall rules
4. **Keep updated** - Apply security patches promptly
5. **Monitor logs** - Watch for suspicious activity
6. **Use strong secrets** - Generate cryptographically secure keys
7. **Backup regularly** - Maintain secure backups
8. **Limit access** - Follow principle of least privilege

#### Essential Security Configurations

```bash
# Generate secure Flask secret key
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Set secure environment variables
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY="your_secure_key_here"
export RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
export CSRF_PROTECTION=true
export CORS_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com"
```

See [SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md](app/SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md) for comprehensive security guidelines.

### For Developers/Contributors

#### Secure Coding Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Sanitize data before display

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Verify signatures properly
   - Check permissions on all endpoints
   - Use secure session management

3. **Cryptography**
   - Use established libraries (never roll your own crypto)
   - Use secure random number generators
   - Follow current best practices

4. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review security advisories
   - Use `safety check` and `bandit`

5. **Error Handling**
   - Don't leak sensitive information in errors
   - Log security events
   - Handle edge cases

#### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Proper authentication/authorization checks
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Secure random number generation
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Logging of security events
- [ ] HTTPS enforced where needed

## Known Security Considerations

### Bitcoin Operations

- **Private Key Security**: Never log or expose private keys
- **RPC Security**: Secure Bitcoin Core RPC with strong passwords and firewall
- **Transaction Validation**: Always validate transactions before broadcasting
- **Wallet Encryption**: Use encrypted wallets in production

### Authentication

- **LNURL-Auth**: Session timeout enforced (5 minutes default)
- **OAuth2**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation
- **Signature Verification**: All signatures cryptographically verified
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented on all authentication endpoints

### API Security

- **CORS**: Configure strict CORS policies in production
- **CSRF**: CSRF protection enabled for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP and per-user rate limits
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted in database
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS required in production
- **Session Security**: Secure session cookies with httpOnly and secure flags
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables, never committed to repo
